          <h3>First Week on GitHub</h3>
          <li>GitHub Pages</li>
          <li>Reviewing pull requests</li>
          <li>Managing merge conflicts</li>
          <li>Securing your workflows</li>
          <br />
          <p>In summary, this course has taught me how to utilize uploading a project onto GitHub in a systematic manner. This is useful because I learned how to maximize my learning by using pull requests to see the changes I have made in the duration of my project. This is also useful for others to view my learning curve when viewing my projects.</p>
