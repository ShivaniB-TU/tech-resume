     <ul>
          <h3>First Day on GitHub</h3>
          <li>Introduction to GitHub</li>
          <li>Communicating using Markdown</li>
          <li>Uploading your project on GitHub</li>
          <br />
          <p>In summary, this course has taught me how to navigate around GitHub. The navigation was focused on uploading projects/ files with data that was on my local desktop.</p>

          <h3>First Week on GitHub</h3>
          <li>GitHub Pages</li>
          <li>Reviewing pull requests</li>
          <li>Managing merge conflicts</li>
          <li>Securing your workflows</li>
          <br />
          <p>In summary, this course has taught me how to utilize uploading a project onto GitHub in a systematic manner. This is useful because I learned how to maximize my learning by using pull requests to see the changes I have made in the duration of my project. This is also useful for others to view my learning curve when viewing my projects.</p>

          <h3>Well Analysis Dashboard</h3>
          <li>Able to import data</li>
          <li>Able to script ironPython for advanced abilities</li>
          <li>Able to create visualizations to easily aggregate data</li>
          <br />
          <p>I was introduced to TIBCO Spotfire at the start of my summer internship in 2019. With no prior experience, I was able to create a dashboard, to fit a clients needs. Using those skills, I was able to create another dashbaord using public data available on IHS Markit. To view a video I created to describe my dashboard, please click the following link: </p>
