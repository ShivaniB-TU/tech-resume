<p>This course was a 16-hour path towards learning the foundation of understanding and utilizing Linux. Not only did it teach me the importance and growth Linux is impacting with many businesses, but also how to use Linux for personal repositories. Understanding the command line facinated me to learn how to engage with my host device (personal laptop) to be of further use. The labs provided through the course included, but wasn't limited to, finding and searching for hardware information, looking for specific data in files or managing libraries on my desktop. I went ahead and challenged my Linux skills to help a Schlumberger employee to download multiple versions of different softwares (e.g. Petrel, Studio) to help him save space on his laptop, but still remain access to all his past projects.</p>

DigitalOcean was the server  The point of this excersise was to challenging but useful to learn how to make my own VPN using DigitalOcean and a linux system. Whilst utilizing Ubuntu when installed into virtual box, I was able to share files from my host device (my laptop) to my virtual disk. Additionally, I created my own Algo VPN that, with my DigitalOcean supported IP network, to verify the connection. </p>
