     <ul>
          <b>First Day on GitHub</b>
          <li>Introduction to GitHub</li>
          <li>Communicating using Markdown</li>
          <li>Uploading your project on GitHub</li>
<p>In summary, this course has taught me how to navigate around GitHub. The navigation was focused on uploading projects/ files with data that was on my local desktop. Furthermore, it taught me how to communicate with other users and do group projects to join files creating a shared project.</p>

          <b>First Week on GitHub</b>
          <li>GitHub Pages</li>
          <li>Reviewing pull requests</li>
          <li>Managing merge conflicts</li>
          <li>Securing your workflows</li>
<p>In summary, this course has taught me how to utilize uploading a project onto GitHub in a systematic manner. This is useful because I learned how to maximize my learning by using pull requests to see the changes I have made in the duration of my project. This is also useful for others to view my learning curve when viewing my projects.</p>

  <details><summary>TIBCO Spotfire</summary>
     <ul>
          <b>Well Analysis Dashboard</b>
          <li>Able to import data</li>
          <li>Able to script ironPython for advanced abilities</li>
          <li>Able to create visualizations to easily aggregate data</li>
<p>I was introduced to TIBCO Spotfire at the start of my summer internship in 2019. With no prior experience, I was able to create a dashboard, to fit a clients needs. Using those skills, I was able to create another dashbaord using public data available on IHS Markit.

  <details><summary>Linux</summary>
     <ul>
          <b>LinuxAcademy LPI Linux Certification</b>
          <li>Linux and open-source operating systems</li>
          <li>Navigating around Linux</li>
          <li>Security and file permissions</li>
<p>This course was a 16-hour path towards learning the foundation of understanding and utilizing Linux. Not only did it teach me the importance and growth Linux is impacting with many businesses, but also how to use Linux for personal repositories. Understanding the command line will be an ongoing process but the course is very rewarding with many challenging labs (e.g. finding and searching for hardware information, or specific data in files, etc).</p>

          <b>Using linux for creating an Algo VPN using Digital Ocean</b>
          <li>Downloaded VirtualBox to test my Linux knowledge</li>
          <li>Downloaded Ubuntu and connected and installed it onto Virtual Box</li>
          <li>Created a VPN network with usernames and passwords</li>
<p>The point of this excersise was to challenging but useful to learn how to make my own VPN using DigitalOcean and a linux system. Whilst utilizing Ubuntu when installed into virtual box, I was able to share files from my host device (my laptop) to my virtual disk. Additionally, I created my own Algo VPN that, with my DigitalOcean supported IP network, to verify the connection. </p>

<p>This course was a 15-hour path towards learning the foundation of understanding and utilizing AWS. With no prior experience with using AWS, I have completed the classes, hands-on-labs and multiple quizzes to test my ability of creating and managing Database services, Storage services, and Instances. Additionally, I now understand how to manage notifications, CloudWatch and Lambda with emphasise to Route 53 and auto scaling.</p>

          <li>Exploring automation</li>
          <li>Able to create visualizations to easily aggregate data</li>
<p>This course served its purpose as a quick training on Powershell however. After running Powershell on my laptop and working the video's individually, I understood how to run my personal commands very easily after looking further into the basic capabilities. This course on LinkedIn provided me assistance with simple navigation, to learning from the actual software from the supportive help system and the adptable snap-ins, to even understanding and extending onto remote management.</p>

<p>This interactive course consisted of labs and quizzes to help me master the Salesforce Platform.

Furthermore, I was able to take advantage of the basic feautures of Salesforce and customize them from an Admin standpoint. I was able to work through the challenges to customize the desktop AND mobile templates to include advanced features such as quick action buttons, dynamic help menus, personable reports from data that I imported and/ or exported to/ from the Salesforce system.</p>
